# Image Classification with CIFAR10 dataset
This repository contains the notebook for loading [CIFAR10 dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html?highlight=datasets)
pre-processing and buiding a model, training and evaluating it on tensosrboard.
 
 > Clone it and run it in your environment.
 - A new __*data*__ folder will be created in your directory that will contain the dataset downloaded. 
 - As you run train the model ,In __*runs*__ folder, the tensorboard outputs will be rendered.
